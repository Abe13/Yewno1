In 1784, on the occasion of peace being made with England, and the
birth of twin Infantes, to give hopes of secure succession to the
throne, the city of Madrid prepared magnificent celebrations of
rejoicings, and among the rest, a prize was proposed for the two best
dramatic pieces that might be offered within sixty days, under the
condition that they should be original, appropriate, and capable of
theatrical pomp and ornament. Out of fifty-seven dramas that were
offered, the prize was awarded to the one sent in by Melendez, ‘The
Bridals of Comacho the Rich,’ a pastoral comedy, which, however, though
abounding in poetical passages, was found on representation wanting
in effect, so as to be coldly received on the stage, where it has not
since been attempted.

This ill-success gave occasion to several detractors of Melendez to
pour forth the effusions of envy or disappointment against him, to
which he gave no other answer than by the publication of his poems
in a collected form. This was in 1785; and the manner in which they
were received, it could be said, had had no parallel in Spain. Four
editions, of which three were furtive, were at once taken up, and all
classes of persons seemed to have the book in hand, commenting on its
excellences. The lovers of ancient poetry, who saw so happily renewed
the graces of Garcilasso, of Leon and Herrera, and “even improved
in taste and perfection,” saluted Melendez as the restorer of the
Castillian Muses, and hailed the banishment of the prosaic style which
had previously prevailed. The applauses extended beyond the kingdom,
and found especially in Italy the admiration repeated, as well as in
France and England, where several of the poems are said to have been
imitated.
